This is a simple example showing basic Usage of the STP C API and how to use
STP as an external project in the CMake build system.

A developer can use either the build tree or installed version of STP. By
default the STP build system registers STP with the user's CMake user package
registry when it is built so things may just work out of the box :)

To build this example simply run

$ mkdir bin/ $ cd bin/ $ cmake-gui ../

Note you can use cmake or ccmake instead of cmake-gui, but I prefer it.

STP_DIR will be set to the location that contains the STPConfig.cmake file that
will be used if it is automatically detected. If not the developer can force
this by setting the STP_DIR variable and recofngiuring. If things aren't
working you should take a look at the CMake documentation on the find_package()
command in config mode.
